## Gameplay
- Low motivation to switch into barrel form
- Lots of bullets turn barrel form into a dash (immediate explosion)
- Low skill ceiling

### Barrel
- Static areas of damage - hard to get enemies to walk into them
- **Dashing into enemies doesn't work**

## Control
- Cursor (make it move with the player, like in Hotline Miami)

## Visual
- Colored blocks look out of place
